To build Intel SHMEM v1.1.0, run:

$ unset BASE
$ ./install_ishmem.sh

This will create an `ishmem_workspace` directory in the current working
directory. The workspace is within another directory corresponding to the Git
branch name. The default branch is `main`, which target the Sunspot system at
Argonne National Lab. An alternative location for the workspace directory can
be set with env var $BASE. Please run the `install_ishmem.sh` script from
within the top-level `ishmem_demo` directory.

After installation is complete, try running an example. In the "example"
directory is a self-contained complete ISHMEM project:

$ cd example
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DISHMEM_INSTALL_PREFIX=${ISHMEM_ROOT}

To revive the ISHMEM environment quickly, for example, in a new terminal session:

$ source ./env/vars.sh

That script is also invoked by `./install_ishmem.sh`
Please run the `vars.sh` script from within the top-level `ishmem_demo` directory.

To start an interactive job on a single Sunspot node:

$ qsub -l select=<num_nodes> -l walltime=30:00 -A Aurora_deployment -q workq -I

where <num_nodes> is 1. Multiple nodes are also supported.

To execute a helloworld test allocated to all 6 GPUs on a single node:

$ mpirun -N 12 -n 12 ./examples/1_helloworld
